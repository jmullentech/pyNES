# Welcome to pyNES!
I've always wanted a straightforward way to launch NES ROMs on a Pi, without the need to use a keyboard or mouse after the very first setup. This is part of the system to get that done!


# Prerequisites 

 - Python 2.7 + pip
 - npyscreen (pip)
 - FCEUX
 - joy2key
		 
*NOTE: I'm using FCEUX but you can modify the script to utilize whatever emulator you prefer*

## Installation & Usage

Just place the file in the directory of your choice and execute it with `python2.7 main.py`

Just remember to modify the values inside the script to match your ROM $PATH
